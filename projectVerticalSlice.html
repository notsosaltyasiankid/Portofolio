        <h1>The project</h1>
        <p class="text-padding">This project was made with the intention to remake a clip from a populair game that we could choose from. I chose to go Darkest Dungeon because I wanted to see how the animation and battle system was made. Eventually I was in a group of 8 people that chose the same game. 4 of them were artists who made the art for the game and the animations. The other 4 were coders who worked on coding the main mechanics for what we have to make. We had about 10 weeks for the project.</p>

            </div>
        <p class="text-padding">I was assigned to code and add the art for the UI. I began to make a placeholder for the UI so that if I recieve the art I could've instantly implement it into the game. Then I started with merging the battle system into my branch so that I could work on scripting buttons onto the UI. After making that I recieved more art form the Game artists and added that. It was about halfway into the project by now and we were up to date with the trello, but there were still lots of things that are not done yet. Right after that I starten with and indicator of someones turn.  And then I started with making a potion button, this potion is used to get buffs but we were running out of time. Eventually I just implemented the potion animation and sounds without the buffs that it would give.</p>
