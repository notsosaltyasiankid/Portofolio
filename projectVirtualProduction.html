        <h1>The project</h1>
        <p class="text-padding">We were tasked to choose a film scene where shoot a short film with in the virtual production way. I was put in a group of 8 people where there were 4 game artists, 3 audiovisual production and 1 game developer. We had choosen the movie star wars and to be more specific the fighting scene with Darth Vader against Obi Wan Kenobi. Me and the game artists had 5 weeks to make a map in Unreal Engine that looks like the one in the movie before we needed to film onset. When we were finished with the map and the 5 weeks were over we went to the Buas in Breda to film and produce it.</p>

        <h1>The part I made</h1>
        <p class="text-padding">My task was to make different kinds of props for the map in blender and importing everything to Unreal Engine. I started with first with the pillars against the wall. When I made the model I went to Substance 3D painter to give it an texture. I gave the model to an game artist so that it could be implemented into the map. Eventually every game artist made their models and put it all in 1 map. We imported everything into Unreal engine and gave it lights around the map. When I went to the studio in Breda I was also tasked to check the audio and footage while they were recording. Also from time to time I get to check up on the Unreal Engine map that they were using for filming.</p>
