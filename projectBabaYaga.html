        <h1>The project</h1>
        <p class="text-padding">My first project where I worked in an team that I coded in. My team consisted of 3 coders and 3 game artists. To stay  We all chose to make an 3d platformer and it needed to be based of of the legend Babayaga. Before we started to make the game we wanted to get an concrete version of the storyline and what parts we need for the game. Also we were looking across different platforms like pinterest for inspiration for the different kinds of vibe we wanted for the game. We had an deadline of approximately 8 to 9 weeks until we needed to show it to the teachers. </p>

        <p class="text-padding">My part of the project started with making an pickup system where if you pick up an key from the ground it could then open an closed door. After a while I made an dev area for me to test the key pickup feature and it worked. The next part was making an pause menu for the game. Making the pause menu was easy but it had alot of glitches and some of my classmates that worked on the project wanted to add an save system to the game. That save system was going to be added with the pause menu but we after some dicsussing it would not be added. I finished making the pause menu and some an game artist in our project made some cutscenes for the game and I eventually added it into the game. I needed to work in premiere pro to add the cutscenes into Unity which eventually worked. After the cutscenes I started making a rough placeholder for the main menu but after some time I got the art to add into the main menu. I checked in trello for some more feature to add but all of them were already done so I took some time off to make an trailer for the game!</p>
